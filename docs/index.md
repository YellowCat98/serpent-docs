# Serpent Docs

- Documentation for using the Serpent GD mod.
- (Serpent is in beta, if there are any bugs, you can report them by joining the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/qnPgmUVZsV))
- By using this mod, you acknowledge that the Developer is not responsible for any damage, data loss, or any harm done to your device that may occur as a result of executing malicious scripts, please do NOT execute scripts sent to you without first checking the source. to check whether a script is malicious or not, you may follow the following steps:
> 1. open the zip file in WinRar, or just anything that lets you view zip files without unzipping,
> - If this file doesn't have the two following files:
> > - "script.json"
> > - A .py (python) file.
> - This means that the script does nothing at all, though it could be an another form of malicious. Do NOT put it in your Geometry dash's script folder, better safe than sorry. Delete the zip file and you do not need to follow the other steps as you have acknowledged that the "script" is most likely malicious.

> 2. If it has a .py (python) file, and a script.json, and no other files. Unzip the zip file.

> 3. Open the .py file in a text editor, notepad should work fine.

> 4. Read the file does.
> - Read what the file does, should be simple. If you acknowledged that the file is safe. you can safely execute the script, if it's not, then immediately delete any files related to the script. Including the zip file.
