# Prerequisities

- Before making mods, you need to first have some stuff installed, Which are:

- Geometry Dash: Serpent is a Geometry Dash mod. so you obviously would need the game you're trying to modify!
- Geode: Serpent is a mod powered using Geode SDK, you can get geode from https://geode-sdk.org!
- Serpent: In order to installed Serpent, you have to go into Geode and then you can download the latest version of Serpent, though as of 11/12/2024, Serpent is yet to be finished! so you'd have to get it from github for now.
- Python: To keep Serpent's size manageable, you need to have python itself installed on your device, you can get python from https://python.org.

- If you got all of these installed, you're ready to continue!
