- Geode: Serpent is a mod powered using Geode SDK, you can get geode from https://geode-sdk.org!
- Serpent: In order to installed Serpent, you have to go into Geode and then you can download the latest version of Serpent
- Python: To keep Serpent's size manageable, you need to have python itself installed on your device, you can get python from https://python.org. (you specifically are required to have Python 3.9.13 in order for serpent itself to load.)
